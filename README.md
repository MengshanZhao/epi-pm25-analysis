## Project Overview
This project examines the *Environmental Protection Interview* (EPI), a high-profile, ranking-based environmental policy in China.  
Using high-frequency satellite PM2.5 data and self-collected health data, I investigate how competitive, ranking-based incentives affect local governments' pollution reduction strategies.

**Key Findings:**
- Cities at risk of EPI sanctions reduced PM2.5 concentrations by **15.7 μg/m³** — ~4x larger than previous estimates.
- Reductions peak in evaluation periods, showing strong **short-term, strategic behavior**.
- Political connections and capital-region oversight shape the *duration* and *consistency* of improvements.

## Data
This analysis combines:
- **Satellite-based PM2.5 concentration** (TAP program, 2000–present, daily at 1 km spatial resolution)
- **Self-collect Health Data** (Gathered from hundreds of png files from government's websites)
- **City-level EPI announcement dates** from Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment
- **Political network data** (provincial leadership connections, matched with self-collected data)
- **City-level control** (GDP, tech share etc)

*Note: Raw datasets cannot be shared. *

## Methods
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** with multiple groups & periods  
- **Continuous treatment specification** to capture intensity of EPI risk  
- **Tournament theory** framing for dynamic incentives  
- Seasonal controls to account for heating and weather-driven PM2.5 variation
